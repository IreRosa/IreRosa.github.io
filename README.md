This is the Designated Detailed Document
    Description of my work:
        Visuals: To figure out the layout and the overall aesthetic of my webpage I used Figma to make my page pleasing to the eye.
        I took the decision to start by setting up all the structure of my website before putting all the content because it is faster that way .
        First I developed the index/home page because there is the access to all the other pages and therefor it is the most important one, I wanted to do a simple layout that was very practical for the user and does not require any explenation in order to understand what to do.
        FOr the HTML part I mostly followed what was written in the power points and sometimes I searched in Google or asked chat gpt ways to do some things that weren't really explained on the website.

    Problems during the development:
        First of all while creating all the basic structure of my webpage I had a problem creating the different folders in wich the documents where going to be. I tried using the terminal to do git add and the git commit and git push to add the folders and files to the repository as was done in the Activity VI but for the folders it wouldn't work and only the files would appear in the online repository. To solve that problem I did the commit and push from the source control section instead of the terminal and there it worked.
        Then I had a problem with the display of the icons on the home menu because they would all stay all the way to the left and they wouldnt be the size that I wanted them to be, to fix that I put an in line style (even though it is not really the best way).
        Also, when I clicked on the link it would take me to the read me file instead of the index and I had a hard time figuring out why but then I realised that I didn't have to change anything in th code I just had to change the settings directly in GitHub in the build and deployment section and change from /root to /docs where my index is.
        Almost all the problems I had were with the layout and size of the images and icons of my website but I managed to solve them by creating containers and in the css modifying the width of each element depending on how many items were in the line.

    Conclusions:
        After finishing this website I can say that eventhough I find it really amusing at times and when I'm inspired designing the website can be entertaining, it really is a tedious task. I think I made the mistake of not using a template because I wanted to do it all myself and I spent most of the time trying to figure out the layout of my page mostly the layout of the images. None the less, this activity really helped me understand all the concepts viewed in class and put them to practice, it also helped reinforce the team spirit of the class because some us did our work in a call to help out eachother when we couldn't figure things out (I want to thank Guillermo García for helping me by solving some doubts I had). So, in conclusion I can say that creating a website by itself is not as difficult as I first though but it can be helpful to use chat GPT to correct some mistakes and having another person to give you their point of view.
