    Problems during the development:
        First of all while creating all the basic structure of my webpage I had a problem creating the different folders in wich the documents where going to be. I tried using the terminal to do git add and the git commit and git push to add the folders and files to the repository as was done in the Activity VI but for the folders it wouldn't work and only the files would appear in the online repository. To solve that problem I did the commit and push from the source control section instead of the terminal and there it worked.
