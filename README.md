    Description of my work:
        Visuals: To figure out the layout and the overall aesthetic of my webpage I used Figma to make my page pleasing to the eye.
        I took the decision to start by setting up all thestructure of my website before putting all the content because it is faster that way .
        First I developed the index/home page because there is the access to all the other pages and therefor it is the most important one, I wanted to do a simple layout that was very practical for the user and does not require any explenation in order to understand what to do.

    Problems during the development:
        First of all while creating all the basic structure of my webpage I had a problem creating the different folders in wich the documents where going to be. I tried using the terminal to do git add and the git commit and git push to add the folders and files to the repository as was done in the Activity VI but for the folders it wouldn't work and only the files would appear in the online repository. To solve that problem I did the commit and push from the source control section instead of the terminal and there it worked.
        Then I had a problem with the display of the icons on the home menu because they would all stay all the way to the left and they wouldnt be the size that I wanted them to be, to fix that I put an in line style (even though it is not really the best way).

    Conclusions:
