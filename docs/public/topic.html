                <br>The main technologies employed in this sector are : <br>
                Actuators - electric motors, hydraulic cylinders, pneumatic cylinders <br>
                Communication technologies - Wi-fi, cellular network, bluetooth <br>
                AI - machine learning, artificial narrow intelligence <br>
